# BCI-centric research on MUSE devices
## I have collated both of my sci-comm project which relates to BCI
1) BCI presentation on EEG technology
2) Font research using EEG device 
## The collection of data requires different modules based on your EEG device. Contact me for Muse2 collection details if interested in MUSE2 EEG collection and analysis
## Visit this website dated around 2019 to know more about BCI (ignore any errors.. it has not been touched/managed/updated for a long time
